# Sample Json
A Json skeleton for a Work in Progress Project

 The Objects in this Json are:
1) The "device"
2) The "date"
3) The "sender" (a person or group of people doing analysis"
4) The "site" (the place)
5) A list of objects (object of analysis) (at least one element)
6) A list of attachments (could be empty)


The other simple strings are:
 - The version of the API
 - The fact if it's a test or not (field "experimental")

Other simple fields could be added, like "notes" 

Normally, once the names are choosen, it should be very unlikely
that those names will change.

What do not change are the elements above, mentioned in the list from 1 to 6.
